I would like to share a compound exec that I developed
to simplify the installation of IONA's OS/390 product.
It searches for  specific DSNs with LMDxxxx ISPF
services, product levels with BAL and ISPF variables,
etc.  The OBJTXT that is embedded extracts the LE level
and exercises/decodes the CSRSI (System Information)
callable service (used by IBM's CUOD).  It also detects
TCP/IP levels and number of stacks.  Perhaps someone
may find some of the code useful.

Regards,  David
